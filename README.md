# Mesh-S — Solar Meshtastic Node

Mesh-S is the project site for a solar-powered Meshtastic node, focused on reliable outdoor operation and autonomous power.
It documents the hardware concept, enclosure approach, and real-world usage considerations.

The project is intended for the Meshtastic / LoRa / outdoor / maker community.
It emphasizes autonomous operation, solar power, and a purpose-built enclosure with practical field constraints in mind.
