# Mesh-S — Solar Meshtastic Node (DIY)

Mesh-S is a **non-commercial DIY project** documenting my personal vision of a solar-powered Meshtastic node
designed for reliable, long-term outdoor operation.

The project focuses on **autonomy, simplicity, and real-world constraints**:
power balance, enclosure design, humidity behavior, mounting options, and long-term outdoor exposure.
It is not a finished product, not a kit, and not an installation guide.

Mesh-S is intended for the **Meshtastic / LoRa / maker community** as a reference project,
inspiration source, and technical documentation of one possible implementation.
