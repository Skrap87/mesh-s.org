# MESH-S  
### DIY Meshtastic Solar Node for Year-Round Outdoor Operation

**MESH-S** is a private, non-commercial DIY project documenting the design and real-world operation of a solar-powered Meshtastic node intended for continuous outdoor use throughout the year.

🌐 Project website: https://mesh-s.org

This repository contains the source code for the project website and serves as a technical documentation hub — not a product page.

## 🔧 Project philosophy

MESH-S is built around a simple idea:

> **Show real behavior instead of making promises.**

The project focuses on practical engineering decisions validated through long-term outdoor operation, rather than theoretical specifications or lab assumptions.

---

## 📌 Key focus areas

- ☀️ Solar-powered autonomous operation  
- ❄️ Winter and low-light behavior  
- 💧 Moisture, condensation, and enclosure sealing  
- 🔋 Battery charge and discharge telemetry  
- 🧱 Modular, serviceable enclosure design  
- 📊 Real Home Assistant telemetry data  

All observations, images, and graphs are based on actual DIY builds deployed outdoors.

## ⚠️ What this project is — and is not

### This project **is**:
- Technical documentation
- An engineering showcase
- A learning resource for Meshtastic and outdoor nodes
- A real-world test platform

### This project **is not**:
- A commercial product
- A finished device
- A kit or assembly service
- A certified or guaranteed design

All assembly, wiring, configuration, and deployment decisions are made entirely by the builder, at their own responsibility.
